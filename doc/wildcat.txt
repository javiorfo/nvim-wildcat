INTRODUCTION                                              *wildcat-introduction*

nvim-wildcat is a Neovim plugin build to provice a better experience while using
Wildfly, JBoss EAP or Tomcat servers with Neovim. This plugin provides
the necessary commands you need to develop with Neovim, Java and Maven. The base 
idea was to have a plugin like Eclipse Server plugin. This includes adding, 
running, stopping, cleaning, building (with Maven) and deploying actions.

================================================================================
1. PREREQUISITES                                         *wildcat-prerequisites*

- Ensure you have Java installed. Although it is a requisite to have Java to run
Wildfly, JBoss EAP or Tomcat; this is the first requisite. 
- Ensure you have Maven installed. nvim-wildcat will throw a warning on start if
Maven is not installed.
- This plugin has been developed under and for Linux OS, following open source
philosophy.

================================================================================
2. SETTINGS                                                   *wildcat-settings*

The following are the basics settings you need to use nvim-wildcat

By default these are de settings. You can modify one or multiple values of it: >
    require'wildcat'.setup{
    	console_size = 15,
        jboss = {
            home = "JBOSS_HOME",
            app_base = "standalone/deployments",
            default = true
        },
        tomcat = {
            home = "CATALINA_HOME",
            app_base = "webapps",
            default = false
        }
    }
<

NOTE: nvim-wildcat will take the 'home' values as environment variables and if
they not exist, then will take the values as absolute paths.

Example:
If wanted to set only Tomcat server as default and set an absolute path, just
set it this way: >
    require'wildcat'.setup{
        tomcat = {
            home = "/path/to/tomcat",
            default = true
        }
    }
<
